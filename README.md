# - Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
- The company hiring our software security team is named Artemis Financial. They are very interested in security for their software since they deal with finances of many people. It is a crucial part to have success for their company so they can provide good security for all their customers. The company works with businesses all around the world, so they are going to need a very secure system to protect all investments and clients.
# - What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
- I feel like i was able to run thechecks well to cover the dependencies and check where vulnerabilities were. Being able to secure software like this is a god skill to be able to have becasue it will pay offf big for many job opportunities and much more. It is important to code securely becasue it makes all the data behind the scenes secure from outside sources, customers dont want their private data being taken and used for injust purposes. Software security adds huge benefits to the customers that are investing in the company. The customers dont have to worry as much about their data being taken or stolen.
# - What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
- Some of the setup and run through was confusing and it wasnt loading evetrything correctly but once i figured it out it was a breeze.
# - How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
- There were a few techniques taken, including securiny the code, cleaning up the layout of the code and making sure we were using the right dependencies for the tasks needed to be accomplished.
# - How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- The code was checked over and made sure to be running, with dependency checks and suppresion of some vulnerabilities. One vulnerability check for the code base is not enough, there need to be multiple checks run especailly after making some changes.
# - What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- I used clean code and different strategies tomake the code more secure and unaccesible by unwanted users.
# - Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
- From this experience i would go on and show the ability to check over vulnerabilities and how to clean them up or suppress them for easier coding and cleaner outputs. Dependency checks are important as well to see what things are going to be running alongside which other programs.
